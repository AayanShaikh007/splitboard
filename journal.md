# Splitboard

## July 9th, 1:17am

Officially begin splitboard. I want to speedrun this project overnight and try to get it complete in around 6 hours. But before that, the project description- splitboard is a hotswappable keyboard that I will be making to address issues in my last keyboard, scalars-keyboard (also on my github profile). 

- Firstly, I completely underestimated the size of the keyboard and what should have been a mid-sized keyboard came out to be bigger than the keyboard i have on my laptop. **Compact form factor is a major element of this project.**
- Next, Ive wanted to try a wireless keyboard design ever since the pico W got bluetooth connectivity. **Wireless connectivity is a must.** Therefore, I need to handle **bluetooth connectivity** and how to **power the board using a battery**. 
- Finally, I want to try a **split keyboard design** for this keyboard for ergonomics.

With that out of the way, I will now start the PCB design.
