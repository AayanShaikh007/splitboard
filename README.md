# Splitboard
### A split keyboard modelled after the Ergodox with wireless connectivity

## What is the Splitboard?

The splitboard is a diy keyboard modelled after the Ergodox that has wireless bluetooth connectivity and on-board battery charging/management. The most striking thing about the keyboard is probably its distinct appearance compared to other keyboards, but hopefully this will add to the ergonomics of the keyboard. For this keyboard, I wanted to incorporate a number of features that I liked about my last keyboard, such as RGB lighting and Kalih hotswap sockets, while also adressing some of the issues with my last keyboard.

## Why did I make the Splitboard?

I made the splitboard as a follow up to my original keyboard to address some mistakes I made in my last keyboard. Firstly, I made the case walls way too thick, at 1 cm, where in reality I only needed 2-4 mm. Additionally, I see now that the keyboard has a very large footprint on my desk and is difficult to move into a comfortable typing position. The splitboard consists of two, very portable halves that can be arranged around your desk in any way you want. Additionally, the case is much more asthetically appealing with low-profile walls (3mm) and a voronoi pattern on the bottom. Check out the product gallery to get a preview of the project.
